Export HeroLab character to pdf sheet


This project is currently in pre beta status of development. 

### What works:


 - Display existing form fields (text and checkbox)
 - Add, delete, resize, move form fields
 - Dynamic font size in text fields
 - Save as pdf with editable form fields

### What partially works:

 - Load pdf character sheet ( only first page)
 - Assign value to field ( incomplete context menu, only a couple options do something)

### What will be added:

- Save form fields position, size, and character sheet attribute as a template
- Multi page character sheet support
- Load and work with images instead of pdf files
- Pdf fields recognition (with naming convention) to allow autofill
- Unrecognized fields hint (different color highlight)
- Options to bind unrecognized fields to character sheet attributes
